===========================================

Introduction
------------

[Italian C++ Community](http://italiancpp.org) is a community intended for networking and
  collaboration in the C++ community.

We value the participation of each member of the Italian C++ Community and
  want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
Accordingly, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to
  other participants throughout the conference and at all conference events,
  whether officially sponsored by Italian C++ Community or not.

To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, exhibitors, sponsors,
  vendors and conference staff at all Italian C++ Community events are required to
  conform to the following Code of Conduct.

For each Italian C++ Community event, the staff will enforce this code.

Italian C++ Community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
  for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
  appearance, body size, race, or religion.
